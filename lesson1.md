# Command Line Magic

## Tips for typing less

- `<cmd> !$` to execute command with the argument of the previous command
- `!!` to execute the previous command. Good for situations when you forget to `sudo`.
  You can just do `sudo !!` to execute the previous command with sudo.
- `C-r` to search backwards for a particular command

## Basic Directory Navigation

- `cd` means change directory
- `cd` to change to home directory
- `cd ~` works the same way
- `cd ..` to go back up one directory level
- `cd -` to go back to where you were previously at
- Use `pwd` to see where you are currently
